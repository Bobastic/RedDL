# RedDL

This simple bash script allows you to download up to around a thousand pictures from a subreddit. You can specify a sort method like hot or top month. This handles galleries and linked images.

There is a thousand image limitation because I use the native Reddit API. If you want to download every image from a subreddit, use RedDL+.
